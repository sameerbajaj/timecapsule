USER CONTEXT:
- Role: ${role}
- Current situation: They just ${situation}
- What they're struggling with: ${struggle}

TRANSCRIPT EXCERPTS FROM LENNY'S PODCAST:
${transcriptContext}

YOUR TASK:
Create a personalized letter that feels like it was written by their future self, using REAL quotes and wisdom from the podcast guests above.

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Find 3 quotes from DIFFERENT guests that speak DIRECTLY to their situation and struggle
2. Each quote should be an actual excerpt from the transcripts (look for powerful, emotionally resonant statements)
3. Provide context for each quote (e.g., "When she first became a design manager at 24")
4. The opening should acknowledge their exact situation with empathy
5. The closing should be encouraging and forward-looking

IMPORTANT: Only use quotes that actually appear in the transcripts. Do not make up quotes.

Return your response as valid JSON in this exact format:
{
  "opening": "A 2-3 sentence opening that acknowledges their situation and struggle with empathy. Reference that you found leaders who were in their exact shoes.",
  "quotes": [
    {
      "text": "The actual quote from the transcript (1-3 sentences max)",
      "guest": "Guest Name",
      "context": "When/where they said this or what they were going through at the time"
    },
    {
      "text": "Second quote",
      "guest": "Guest Name",
      "context": "Context for this quote"
    },
    {
      "text": "Third quote",
      "guest": "Guest Name",
      "context": "Context for this quote"
    }
  ],
  "closing": "A brief, encouraging closing (2-3 sentences). End with something like 'Keep going.' or 'Keep building.'",
  "episodeLinks": [
    {
      "guest": "Guest Name",
      "title": "Episode title"
    }
  ]
}

Make the letter feel personal, warm, and like genuine wisdom from people who've been there. The quotes should hit hard emotionally.`;
